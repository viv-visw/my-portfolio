# **A Deeper Analysis Of Instagram’s New Changes. Here’s How Your Brand Can Effectively Leverage Them!**


## Background

I’ve always enjoyed photography & how Instagram thrives on the power of visual storytelling, showcasing its effectiveness in comparison to text-based narratives. Through my social media experiences, I learnt how to leverage several Instagram tips & tricks and wanted to analyse what works & what doesn’t on the platform (DOs & DONTs). This motivated me to analyse Instagram from different perspectives — individuals and businesses alike — and provide strategies tailored to different kinds of brands based on their business model, that could be used to increase customer engagement and turn a business profit.


## Problem Statement

How can businesses leverage different Instagram marketing strategies, tailored to their brand and business model, and ultimately ensure business growth? 

  
## My Contributions

I wrote the entire article :P

Just kidding! Here are the main highlights:

- I tried to highlight the Instagram features that were the newest at the time

  - Stories Ads
  - News Feed Algorithm
  - IGTV
  - Instagram Checkout
  - Hidden ‘Likes’


- I developed a new template to analyse Instagram on 4 important facets

  - What’s Critical
  - What’s New
  - DOs
  - DON’Ts


## Impact

* This was my love for writing, photography, and Instagram manifesting itself. So, I wasn’t personally seeking any real impact.

* On Medium, the article currently enjoys 272 claps/likes! (So, some people definitely found it useful, haha!)
