## Introduction

Hybrid workplaces are rapidly becoming the norm in today’s post-pandemic world. Based on recent surveys[<sup>[1]</sup>](https://techaisle.com/research-reports/235-2022-top-10-upper-midmarket-business-issues-it-priorities-it-challenges-infograp), a key business focus, especially for small and mid-sized businesses, should be to invest in the latest workplace-suitable business phones. This is justified because suitable business phones significantly influence productivity, cross-functional collaboration, and employee morale across geographically distributed teams.


## Problems

Unfortunately, several studies show that many business phones exhibit crucial shortcomings:


#### Lack of App Versatility
  
- No support for project management apps like Slack, Trello, Asana that facilitate flexible & productive teamwork.

- Flexibility is critical: 76% want it in where they work (location), 93% want it in when they work (time zones).[<sup>[2]</sup>](https://futureforum.com/pulse-survey/)

- Unreliable support for the latest multimedia content formats for documents, presentations, videos, and images.


#### Poor Cybersecurity Standards
  
- 76% Europeans feel they are vulnerable to cybercrime including ransomware, malware, and data/email threats.[<sup>[3]</sup>](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/society/20220120STO21428/)

- Incompatibility with latest industry-standard 2-factor authentication, security alerts, and password protections.


#### Poor Phone Performance & Storage
  
- Poor speed, cross-platform compatibility, unreliable 4G/5G support.

- Inferior hardware specifications - battery life, charging speed, and storage capabilities for memory-heavy apps.


## Generic Solution

Address these problems to ensure higher team morale, improved collaboration, increased productivity and, therefore, higher financial growth & business impact.


## Specific Solution

Invest in the new Samsung Galaxy S22 Series, with hybrid workplace efficiency as its design philosophy[<sup>[4]</sup>](https://insights.samsung.com/2022/02/09/doing-more-with-mobile-in-the-hybrid-workplace/), because:
