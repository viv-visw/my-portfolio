# White Paper Documentation  


## Overview

This project is intended to showcase my experience, understanding, and _general_ style of creating a **1-page** white paper.


## Highlights

This documentation aims to convince enterprise IT influencers to buy Samsung phones for their workplace, provides information on why these phones would make a tangible difference to their financial growth, and highlights references & resources for further reading.

Specifically, it contains the following sections:

- Introduction
- Problems
- Generic Solution
- Specific Solution
- Conclusion
- References


## Author Notes

- This document is written entirely using Markdown.

- Examples that would influence the overall documentation:

  - Confluence macros.

  - Documentation look and feel.

  - Colour schemes.

  - And more...

- The aim is to present a **1-page** white paper. The documentation structure would look significantly different if the scope of the paper is extended beyond one page.

- I have used American English standards and grammar for this project. 

- Generally speaking, I can create product documentation conforming to different English standards, as per project need.
