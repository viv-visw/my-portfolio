# The Transformer Model



## Overview

The [Transformer Model](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7181-attention-is-all-you-need.pdf) is based on the idea of applying "attention" to only a handful of details to complete a particular task while discarding the rest.   

Conceptually, it is based on the idea of mimicking the human cognitive process of selectively focusing only on specific parts of any information resource, compared to the rest, to solve a problem. From machine translation to natural language processing tasks and beyond, transformer models have come to redefine the state-of-the-art across several machine learning (ML) research domains and continue to enable spectacular breakthroughs within the broader artificial intelligence community. Therefore, this project aims to explain:

* what the transformer model is
* how the transformer model works
* all important details you would need to gain a useful intuition
* some technical implmementations to solve specific real-world tasks



## Scope

This project aims to answer the following questions about the transformer model:

* What is the transformer model?
* Why is it more successful than traditional sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) deep learning models?
* How does the theoretical deisgn of the transformer model ensure improved learning, in comparison to traditional deep recurrent neural networks?
* How can I use the transformer model to solve a particular task?



## Outcomes 

At the end of this documentation, you will have a clear understanding of:

* what the transformer model is and why it is significant
* why this model performs better than traditional seq2seq deep learning models
* how you can build this model for your task



## Target Audience

This documentation is meant for readers interested in/working on:
* understanding how attention models work
