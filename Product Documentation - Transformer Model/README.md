# Product Documentation  



## Overview

This project is intended to showcase my experience, understanding, and _general_ style of creating product documentation. 



## Highlights

This documentation describes the [Transformer model](/The%20Transformer%20Model/Project%20README.md), a popular class of deep learning models, and provides information on how these models function, how they are used, and resources for further reading: 
* Getting Started
* How-to Guides
* Important Concepts
* References



## Author Notes

* I have only used Markdown for this documentation (and no other tools)
* The documentation would look different if I'd have used Confluence, Jupyter Notebooks, or Sphinx. 
* Some examples:
  * Confluence macros.
  * Documentation look and feel.
  * Colour schemes.
  * etc.
* I have used British English standards and grammar for this project. 
* Generally speaking, I can create product documentation conforming to different English standards, as per business need.
