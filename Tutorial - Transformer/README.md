# Product Documentation  


## Overview

This project is intended to showcase my experience, understanding, and _general_ style of creating product documentation. 


## Highlights

This documentation describes the [Transformer model](The%20Transformer%20Model/README.md), a popular class of deep learning models, and provides information on how these models function, how they are used, and resources for further reading: 

* Getting Started
* How-to Guides
* Important Concepts
* References


## Author Notes

* I have only used Markdown for this documentation (and no other tools)

* The documentation would look different had I used Confluence, Jupyter Notebooks, or Sphinx, especially the following aspects:

  * Confluence macros.

  * Documentation look and feel.

  * Colour schemes.

  * and so on

* I have used **British English** standards and grammar for this project.

* Generally speaking, I can create product documentation conforming to different English standards, as per business need.
