# **DeepCancer**: Detecting Cancer via Deep Generative Learning Through Gene Expressions


## Background

DeepCancer was the outcome of an investigative study focused on understanding the effectiveness of [generative adversarial networks (GANs)](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2014/file/5ca3e9b122f61f8f06494c97b1afccf3-Paper.pdf) and deep [convolutional neural networks](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2012/file/c399862d3b9d6b76c8436e924a68c45b-Paper.pdf) in the bioinformatics domain.


## Problem Statement

Using the microarray breast cancer data publicly available in the [NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) repository, the aim of DeepCancer was to accurately diagnose inflammatory breast cancer in a given patient. The novel approach involved using the [deep convolutional GAN (DCGAN)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434) architecture for this diagnosis. 

  
## My Contributions

Over the course of the efforts, I worked on:

* Researching, implementing, and testing the baseline Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine models using traditional machine learning (ML) techniques.

* Architecting the machine learning pipeline from data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training & testing, to model evaluation.

* Conducting experiments on 4 different hyperparameters across the two models to discover the best hyperparameters that exhibited the best performance.

* Measuring and plotting different performance metrics like Precision-Recall, F1-Score, and the standard Confusion Matrix to differentiate DeepCancer from the traditional ML approach.

* Authoring the entire DeepCancer paper based on in-depth collaboration with my co-author for understanding the novel proposed solution and all the technical details of the model.

* Iteratively improving the overall quality of the research paper by frequently collecting and incorporating feedback from my lab supervisor, co-author

* Collaborating with the peer reviewers of the journal and communicating all the incorporated feedback and suggestions.
