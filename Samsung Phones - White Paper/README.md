# White Paper Documentation  



## Overview

This project is intended to showcase my experience, understanding, and _general_ style of creating a white paper. 


> **âœ… NOTE** 
> * The information architecture style of this documentation is inspired by my in-depth research on several popular white paper templates companies use/have developed over time for authoring white papers. 
> * The aim is to present a ***1-page*** white paper.
> * The documentation structure would look significantly different if the scope of the paper is extended beyond one page.



## Highlights

This documentation aims to convince enterprise IT influencers to buy Samsung phones for their workplace, provides information on why these phones would make a tangible difference to their financial growth, and highlights references & resources for further reading.

It contains the following sections:
* Introduction
* Problems
* Generic Solution
* Specific Solution
* Conclusion
* References



## Author Notes

* I have ***only*** used Markdown for this documentation (and no other tools)
* The documentation would look different had I used Confluence, Jupyter Notebooks, or Sphinx. 
* Examples that would influence the overall documentation:
  * Confluence macros.
  * Documentation look and feel.
  * Colour schemes.
  * And more...
* The aim is to present a ***1-page*** white paper. The documentation structure would look significantly different if the scope of the paper is extended beyond one page.
* I have used American English standards and grammar for this project. 
* Generally speaking, I can create product documentation conforming to different English standards, as per business need.
