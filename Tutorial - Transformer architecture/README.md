# Product Documentation  


## Overview

This project showcases my experience, understanding, and _general_ preference of creating an information architecture for a complex product and documenting its features and capabilities for different audiences.


## Highlights

This documentation describes the [Transformer model](The%20Transformer%20Model/README.md), a popular deep learning architecture that's been applied to a wide variety of tasks, from natural language to computer vision, finance, to cybersecurity. 

The following sections provide more information on how these models function, how they are used, and relevant resources for further reading:

- Getting Started
- How-To Guides
- Important Concepts
- References and Further Reading


## Author Notes

- I have only used **Markdown** for this documentation (and no other tools).

- I have used **British English** standards and grammar for this project.

    - Generally speaking, I can create product documentation conforming to different English standards, as per business need.

- The documentation would look different had I used other tools such as Hugo, Jupyter Notebooks, CSS, or Sphinx, especially the following aspects:

  - Hugo shortcodes

  - CSS for customized look and feel.

  - Table of contents using the Sphinx-style `toctree`.

  - and so on.
