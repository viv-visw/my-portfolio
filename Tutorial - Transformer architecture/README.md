# Product Documentation  


## Overview

This project intends to showcase my experience, understanding, and _general_ preference of documenting a complex product.


## Highlights

This documentation describes the [Transformer model](The%20Transformer%20Model/README.md), a popular class of deep learning models, and provides information on how these models function, how they are used, and resources for further reading: 

- Getting Started
- How-to Guides
- Important Concepts
- References


## Author Notes

- I have only used **Markdown** for this documentation (and no other tools)

- I have used **British English** standards and grammar for this project.

- The documentation would look different had I used Confluence, Jupyter Notebooks, or Sphinx, especially the following aspects:

  - Confluence macros.

  - Documentation look and feel.

  - Colour schemes.

  - and so on

- Generally speaking, I can create product documentation conforming to different English standards, as per business need.
