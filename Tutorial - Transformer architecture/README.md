# Product Documentation  


## Overview

This project showcases my experience, understanding, and _general_ preference of creating an information architecture for a complex product and documenting its features and capabilities for different audiences.


## Highlights

This documentation describes the [Transformer model](The%20Transformer%20Model/README.md), a popular deep learning architecture that's been applied to a wide variety of machine learning and software applications. 

The following sections provide more information on how these models function, how they are used, and relevant resources for further reading:

- [Getting Started](The%20Transformer%20Model/Getting%20Started.md)
- [How-To Guides](The%20Transformer%20Model/How%20to%20use%20Transformers%20for%20Translation.md)
- [Important Concepts](The%20Transformer%20Model/Important%20Concepts.md)
- [References and Further Reading](The%20Transformer%20Model/References%20and%20Further%20Reading.md)


## Author Notes

- I have only used **Markdown** for this documentation (and no other tools).

- I have used **British English** standards and grammar for this project.

    - NOTE â€” I can create product documentation conforming to different English standards, as per business need.

- The documentation would look different had I used other tools such as Hugo, Jupyter Notebooks, CSS, or Sphinx, especially the following aspects:

  - Hugo shortcodes

  - CSS for customized look and feel.

  - Table of contents using the Sphinx-style `toctree`.

  - and so on.
