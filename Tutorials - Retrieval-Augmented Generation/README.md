# Product Documentation  


## Overview

This project is intended to showcase my experience, understanding, and _general_ style of creating product documentation. This documentation includes the following sections:


## Highlights

This documentation describes the [Retrieval Augmented Generation](/Retrieval-Augmented%20Generation:%20Product%20Documentation/), a technique that enhances the output of a language model by incorporting external knowledge as enriching context. The documentation is broken into the following components of information: 

* Getting Started
* How-to Guides
* Important Concepts
* References
* Further reading



## Author Notes

* I have only used Markdown for this documentation (and no other tools)
* The documentation would look different had I used Confluence, Jupyter Notebooks, Sphinx or the following tools:
  * Confluence macros.
  * Documentation look and feel.
  * Colour schemes.
* I have used **American English** standards and grammar for this project. 
  * However, I have in-depth experience in creating technical documentation that conforms to different English standards, as per need.
